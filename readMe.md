The aim of this project is to create a python code for AKS primality testing algorithm
I believe that This project was concluded to an end.

Observations .

- Aks working.
- using fft to calculate the polynomial multiplication is working. However, it gives wrong results once the numbers get big enough. This is due to floating point errors. One could try to use arbitrary precision floating points but they are really slow. Therefore, this approach will be dropped.

- Using NNT to do the polynomial multiplication get to its limits quickly. Therefore, one should really drop it.

Conclusion:-

Implement AKS in C/C++ using fast and reliable libraries.
This will be the topic of another repository. Therefore, work on this repo will be stopped
